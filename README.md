# Loan-prediction-ml-model

## Project Title:
Loan Eligibility Prediction using Machine Learning

## Objective:
To build a machine learning model that accurately predicts whether a loan applicant is eligible for a loan based on personal, financial, and credit-related features, helping banks streamline their loan approval process and reduce risk.

## Tools & Technologies Used:
Python ‚Äì for model development

Pandas & NumPy ‚Äì for data manipulation

Matplotlib  ‚Äì for exploratory data analysis and visualization

Scikit-learn ‚Äì for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation

Jupyter Notebook ‚Äì as the development environment

## Dataset Details:
Source: Kaggle ‚Äì Loan Prediction Dataset

Features: Gender, Marital Status, Education, Applicant Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, Property Area, etc.

Target: Loan Status (Y/N)

üîç Approach:
Data Cleaning:

Handled missing values for features like LoanAmount and Credit_History

Converted categorical variables using Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Uncovered trends such as higher approval rates for applicants with credit history and steady income

Identified correlations between features and target variable

Model Building:

Tried multiple classification algorithms:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

XGBoost

Hyperparameter tuning performed using GridSearchCV

Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix

Best model achieved ~82% accuracy on test data

üß† Key Learnings & Insights:
Applicants with credit history, higher income, and less loan amount had better chances of loan approval

Random Forest outperformed other models in both accuracy and generalization

Feature importance analysis helped explain model decisions

üí° Real-world Applications:
Assists banks and NBFCs in automating loan approvals

Minimizes manual errors and improves decision consistency

Can be integrated into a loan application portal with real-time eligibility feedback

üìå Future Scope:
Deploy model as a web app using Flask or Streamlit

Incorporate additional features like credit score, employment history

Retrain periodically with real-time data
